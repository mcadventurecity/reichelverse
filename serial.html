            <h2>Weekly Serial Stories</h2>
            <p>The first Reichelverse Serial, <span>The Campbell Chronicles</span>, is a futuristic coming-of-age story beginning in the early 2040s. Lawrence Campbell, a 14 year old boy from a working-class family, finds himself in unfamiliar territory after his family faces a series of financial crises. When he and his parents are evicted from their home, his mom's estranged brother, William, offers Lawrence's family a second chance. However, Lawrence's Uncle is none other than William Moore, a billionaire software mogul and the founder of Moore Enterprises, whose indifference to his family, including Lawrence's mother, has pushed them away. Therefore, this offer seems strange, yet Lawrence's mother accepts.</p>
            <p>After the Campbell family moves into William's vast mansion in Virginia, Lawrence must begin his freshman year of high school in an extremely foreign situation. Will Lawrence thrive in this new, wealthier life? How will this shape his future? And most importantly, does his uncle have any hidden intentions?</p>
            <p>The prologue of The Campbell Chronicles is scheduled to release on November 19, 2021.</p>
